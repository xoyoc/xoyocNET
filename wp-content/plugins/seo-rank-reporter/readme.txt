**History:**

While traffic is a good measurement of SEO, online marketers who take their SEO seriously, will also use rankings as a major KPI (key performance indicator) of their work. Many SEO tools exist to track Google rankings. However, these tools can be pricey and bulky. 

The SEO Rank Reporter tool was built to offer a simple ranking measurement tool for Wordpress websites. Users can now view how their website ranks for a number of different keywords right within their Wordpress admin panel. 

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the entire directory `/seo-rank-reporter/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Click on the new Admin Section, `Rank Reporter,` and then the menu item, `Add Keywords`
1. Add a new keyword/url set to track by entering your desired keyword and url and then clicking `Add to Reporter`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often are my keyword/url sets checked? =

The SEO Rank Reporter checks your Google rankings every three days using Wordpress's built-in cron function

== Screenshots ==

1. The SEO Rank Reporter displays a graph of keywords you've selected and how they've changed in rankings over time.
2. Along with the graph, the Rank Reporter also displays a table of all the keywords you've added. Columns include the original rank of the keyword/url and its current rank. 
3. On another page, you can juxtapose a keyword's rank with it's traffic. This graph shows the number of hits your website has received for a particular keyword. This is helpful to see if your traffic significantly increases with a boost in rankings. 
4. Receive email notifications if a keyword/url set suddenly jumps or drops in rankings.
